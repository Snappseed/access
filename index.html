This means that we are responsible for deciding how we collect, store and use your personal data. For personal data collected from residents in California, we are the business with respect to your personal data. This means we are responsible for the purposes and means of processing your personal data. “Personal data” as used in this notice shall have the meaning ascribed to it under data protection laws and may also be defined as “personal information” or “personally identifiable information.”<br />If you have any questions about this privacy notice, please contact us by using the details given below.

Subject to your compliance with certain rules and restrictions outlined in our Terms of Use you may dispose of, use, share, otherwise exploit your User Content for your own purposes. However, any use of User Content is at your sole risk, i. e. you assume and bear all risks and responsibility associated with your use of User Content. It is your sole responsibility to ensure compliance with the applicable laws while using the User Content. Please note that we engage third party service providers - OpenAI, L.L.C and Amazon, Inc and Suno, LLC for the purpose of processing and creation of AI-generated User content.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Information we receive from third-party logins:</strong> If you choose to log into the App using a third-party login such as Facebook or Apple, we’ll receive information from those third parties for account verification purposes in accordance with what you have agreed with those parties under their settings and terms and conditions (such as your name and email address). Please note that the social network may independently collect information about you through the integration.<br /><strong>Information we collect about you automatically while you use the App:</strong> We will:<br /><ul><li data-list="bullet">Collect a unique identifier from Apple/Google in order to link your use of the App for billing through iTunes and for advertising purposes;</li><li data-list="bullet">Collect your device operating system and version;</li><li data-list="bullet">To the extent the App is enabled to be integrated with voice-activated devices, collect audio through your microphone on your device to effectuate an instruction or request by you; and/or</li><li data-list="bullet">Collect technical information regarding your use of the App.</li></ul><strong>Information collected automatically by third parties:</strong><br />Information is collected by third-party SDKs (i.e. software development kits) on the App and our website providers, rather than being collected by us directly. This includes the following categories of data: identifiers (such as user IDs and device IDs); usage data (such as your interactions with the App); diagnostics (such as crash logs); contact information (such as your name and email); and health and fitness information (which you input into the App). This information is shared so as to allow the App to operate, for analytics and product personalisation purposes and to run efficient marketing campaigns. To see how they use this information please refer to their privacy policies. We have provided links to these.

Data used by our third-party advertising partners in connection with our advertising campaigns may include data collected from other sources such as data brokers, partners that engage in joint marketing activities, publicly available data including data in the public domain and social networks with which you interact.<br /><strong>Payment details:</strong> In-App purchases are handled by third-party payment platforms. The processing and storage of payment details is a matter for the relevant platform and the applicable payment methods/processors. Where third party payment providers are used we will not receive, process or store any of your payment details. This is because the payment transactions themselves are completed through the relevant platforms (e.g. Apple’s App Store or Google Play) via the user account you have associated with that platform account. If you make purchases within the App, we are notified by the payment processor once a transaction takes place but we will not receive any of your actual payment details.<br />Where you purchase a subscription directly from us (or our group companies) on our website, you may be asked for your credit card, PayPal details or details of such other payment method that we permit from time to time. We don’t have access to your credit card data. Credit card data is tokenized for security and processed by our third party Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) certified payment processors.<br /><strong>Interactions with Other Parties</strong>.

The information collected and stored by those parties remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with us, your rights and choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in your country of residence or elsewhere. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.<br /><strong>Our lawful basis or business purposes for using your personal data</strong><br />In accordance with applicable data protection law, we will only process your personal data where we have a lawful basis for doing so or for our business and commercial purposes.

Some of these tracking technologies may track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you (“<strong>Interest-based Advertising</strong>”).<br />We also use audience matching services to reach people (or people similar to people) who have visited our App or are identified in one or more of our databases (“Matched Ads”). This is done by us uploading a customer list to another party or incorporating a pixel or SDK from another party into our own App, and the other party matching common factors between our data and their data or other data sets. For instance, we incorporate the Facebook SDK on our App and may share your email address with Facebook as part of our use of Facebook Custom Audiences.<br />If you would like to prevent this sharing then please change your settings.<br /><ul><li data-list="bullet">For more information on how to change your advertising settings on an Apple iOS device see here: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT205223</li><li data-list="bullet">For more information on how to change your advertising settings on an Android Device see here: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en-US</li></ul><strong>Transfers of your personal data outside the UK and EEA</strong><br />Our customers in the UK and European Economic Area (EEA) should note that your personal data will be transferred outside the UK and/or EEA to the US.
