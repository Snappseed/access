You and the Company, and each of our respective agents, corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, agree to BINDING ARBITRATION (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court), as the exclusive form of dispute resolution except as provided for below, for all disputes and claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the Privacy Policy) or the Service, unless you are located in a jurisdiction that prohibits the exclusive use of arbitration for dispute resolution.

The arbitrator may not award relief for or against anyone who is not a party. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. This waiver of class actions and collective relief is an essential part of this arbitration provision and cannot be severed from it.<br /><ol><li data-list="ordered"><strong>Arbitration Procedures.</strong></li></ol>Any disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including any questions regarding its existence, validity, or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION under the London Court of International Arbitration (“LCIA”) Rules in force when the Notice of Arbitration is submitted, which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause.<br />- <em>Overview</em>. Arbitration is an alternative to litigation where a neutral person (the arbitrator) hears and decides the parties’ dispute. Arbitration proceedings are designed to provide parties with a fair hearing in a manner that is faster and less formal than court proceedings. The following procedures (the “Arbitration Procedures”) are applicable to all arbitration proceedings involving you and us.<br />- <em>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</em>. We are always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently. Therefore, before you commence an arbitration, we suggest that you contact us to explain your complaint, as we may be able to resolve it without the need for arbitration. You may contact us online at email address indicate in Section 15.<br />- <em>Administrator</em>. The administrator for the arbitration is the LCIA, a non-profit organization that is not affiliated with us. The arbitrator who will hear and decide your dispute will be appointed by the LCIA in accordance with its rules. Information about the LCIA’s rules and fees can be found at:<a href="https://www.lcia.org/Dispute_Resolution_Services/lcia-arbitration-rules-2014.aspx">https://www.lcia.org//Dispute_Resolution_Services/lcia-arbitration-rules-2014.aspx</a>.<br />- <em>Seat of Arbitration</em>. The seat of the arbitration shall be London, United Kingdom.<br />- <em>Choice of Law</em>. The governing law applicable to the arbitration agreement and the arbitration shall be the laws of England and Wales (also known as English Law), without regard to English Law’s conflict of laws rules.<br />- <em>Language</em>. The language of the arbitration shall be English.<br />- <em>Applicable Rules</em>. The arbitration will be governed by the LCIA’s Arbitration Rules (“LCIA Rules”), as modified by these Arbitration Procedures. If there is any inconsistency between the LCIA’s Rules and these Arbitration Procedures, the Arbitration Procedures will control. However, if the arbitrator determines that strict application of the Arbitration Procedures would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration, the arbitrator may make any order necessary to provide a fundamentally fair arbitration that is consistent with the LCIA Rules.<br />- <em>Commencing an Arbitration</em>. To commence an arbitration against us, you must complete a written request for arbitration, submit it to the LCIA, and send a copy to us at email address indicate in Section 15. To learn more about commencing an arbitration and to obtain a form to institute arbitration, see the LCIA’s online filing page,<a href="https://onlinefiling.lcia.org/">https://onlinefiling.lcia.org/</a>. You may represent yourself in the arbitration or have a lawyer (or some other representative) act on your behalf. Upon receipt of an arbitration claim, we may assert any counterclaims it may have against the complaining party.<br />- <em>Fees</em>. You are responsible for paying your portion of the fees set forth in the LCIA’s Schedule of LCIA Arbitration Costs and as determined by the Arbitral Tribunal under LCIA Rules. We will pay all remaining fees. If your claim against us is for less than USD1,000, we will pay all fees. You may hire an attorney to represent you in arbitration. You are responsible for your attorneys’ fees and additional costs. Notwithstanding anything in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, we will pay all fees and costs that we are required by law to pay.<br />- <em>Selection of the Arbitrator</em>. The arbitrator who will hear and decide your dispute will be appointed by the LCIA in accordance with its rules.<br />- <em>Discovery</em>. Each party may (a) request relevant, non-privileged documents from the other party; and (b) request that the other party provide the particulars of its claims or defenses. Any such discovery requests must be served on the other party within 10 days after the arbitrator’s appointment. The responding party shall provide the requesting party with all responsive, non-privileged documents, the requested particulars, and/or any objections to the requests within 15 days after receipt of the requests. Any disputes about discovery or requests for extensions shall be submitted promptly to the arbitrator for prompt resolution. In ruling on any discovery dispute or extension request, the arbitrator shall take into consideration the nature, amount, and scope of the underlying arbitration claim, the cost and other effort what would be involved in providing the requested discovery, the case schedule, and whether the requested discovery is necessary for the adequate preparation of a claim or defense.<br />- <em>Communications with the Arbitrator</em>. Whenever communicating with the arbitrator, the parties must include each other – for example, by including the other party on a telephone conference call and copying the other party on any written submissions, such as letters or emails. To the extent practicable, conferences with the arbitrator will take place by telephone conference call or email. Ex parte communications are not permitted with any arbitrator.<br />- <em>Confidentiality</em>. Upon either party’s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted filing of confidential information must be done under seal.<br />- <em>Arbitration Award</em>. The arbitrator will render a written decision within 14 days after the hearing or, if no hearing was held, within 30 days after any rebuttal or supplemental statements are due. The decision must clearly specify the relief, if any, awarded and contain a brief statement of the reasons for the award.<br />- <em>Waiver of Appeal</em>. The parties waive any right to refer any question of law and any right of appeal on the law and/or the merits to any court.<br />- <em>Survivability</em>. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Terms.<br /><ol><li data-list="ordered"><strong>GOVERNING LAW</strong></li><li data-list="ordered">These Terms shall be governed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales (excluding its body of law governing conflicts of law).</li><li data-list="ordered">To the extent that any action relating to any dispute hereunder is for whatever reason not submitted to arbitration, each of the parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction to the courts of England and Wales to settle any disputes which may arise out of or in connection with this Terms and that accordingly proceedings must be brought in such courts.</li><li data-list="ordered">The parties irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the courts of England and waive any defenses of improper venue or forum non conveniens.</li><li data-list="ordered"><strong>MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</strong></li><li data-list="ordered">No delay or omission by us in exercising any of our rights occurring upon any noncompliance or default by you with respect to these Terms will impair any such right or be construed to be a waiver thereof, and a waiver by the Company of any of the covenants, conditions or agreements to be performed by you will not be construed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach thereof or of any other covenant, condition or agreement hereof contained.</li><li data-list="ordered">Subject to Section 12, if any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then these Terms will remain in full force and effect and will be reformed to be valid and enforceable while reflecting the intent of the parties to the greatest extent permitted by law.</li><li data-list="ordered">Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, these Terms set forth the entire agreement between you and the Company regarding its subject matter, and supersede all prior promises, agreements or representations, whether written or oral, regarding such subject matter.</li><li data-list="ordered">The Company may transfer or assign any and all of its rights and obligations under these Terms to any other person, by any way, including by novation, and by accepting these Terms you give the Company consent to any such assignment and transfer.
